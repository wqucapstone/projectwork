## Description

The commodities market, particularly the oil sector, plays a pivotal role in global economies impacting the outlook for overall global growth and employment. Commodities are highly volatile and are not only susceptible to macro and microeconomic factors but also to geopolitical risk factors which are often quite difficult to model. These uncertainties make it difficult for market participants to analyze, predict and risk manage effectively. We approach this problem by employing a comprehensive approach to understanding the market dynamics, volatility, and risk management, and incorporate the impact of ESG push towards alternative energy sources.
