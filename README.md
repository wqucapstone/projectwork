## Description

The commodities market, particularly the oil sector, plays a pivotal role in global economies impacting the outlook for overall global growth and employment. Commodities are highly volatile and are not only susceptible to macro and microeconomic factors but also to geopolitical risk factors which are often quite difficult to model. These uncertainties make it difficult for market participants to analyze, predict and risk manage effectively. We approach this problem by employing a comprehensive approach to understanding the market dynamics, volatility, and risk management, and incorporate the impact of ESG push towards alternative energy sources. 

## Getting Started

Market Dynamics Understanding and Assessment: 

We have conducted an analysis of the Commodity Market Dynamics using various data sources (see Bibliography). 

## Data Sources Utilized: 

Reliable data sources that are freely accessible have been used to source specific macroeconomic, microeconomic, and geopolitical risk factors that have been identified as part of the initial assessment.  

Federal Reserve Economic Data - FRED is a reliable source for historical macroeconomic data. 

EIA (Energy Information Administration) is an official source for Energy Markets Macro/Microdata. 

EPU (Economic Policy Uncertainty) is part of the Fed and is a source of geopolitical data. 	

NYMEX Market Data (part of CME), where all the Oil markets and Derivatives are traded.
